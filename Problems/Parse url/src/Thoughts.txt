There are many ways to solve this problem.
Some ways  are
1. Use the split() method to split the string based on the "?" character first.
    This will split the string between the URL and the meta data.
    Take the meta data portion (which will be the pass=.... and further split this
    based on the "&" character.
    This will give you and array of meta data strings
    pass=1234
    port=8080 etc..
    Take these strings and further split them by "=" to get the key:value pairs
2. Use regular expression to find the word based on key names.  Use boundary
    expression to search up to i.e one boundary key would be "&" character.
3. Use the indexOf(..) method to find the characters which define the required
    string in the key part.
